## Advanced Programming Assignments (a.a. 21/22)

This repository contains the code wrote for the **Advanced Programming** course's assignments (academic year 2021/2022). 

### First Assignment

The three exercise composing the assignment are written purely in Java (using JDK 11). 

### TicTacToe
The goal of the first exercise is to write a GUI application using Java Beans Software Components to build a Tic Tac Toe game. 
The game strongly uses event-based communication to allow interaction between GUI components.

### Lost Source Code
The second and thrid exercies is a "*reverse-enginereering*" task. A developer, who left the company for a better job, has left several cipher algorithms compiled in "`.class`" files. 
The goal of the exercise is to write a "*testing framework*" (using Java's reflection API) to determine which classes work as expected.

The third exercise just use the Java's Annotations onto the method to get more information about the code.
